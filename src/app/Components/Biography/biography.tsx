            Welcome to my portfolio! My name is John Desiderio, 
            and I am a recent graduate from the University of Georgia. 
            I am a junior software engineer looking for an opportunity 
            to prove my worth and contribute to meaningful projects that 
            make a difference. I have experience working on different web 
            projects and with new technologies. My interest is in full-stack 
            development, which is the area I want to grow the most as a 
            software engineer. Click over to the projects section and look 
            at the projects section to learn more about the different things 
            I have worked on and the current projects I want to finish!
